Hey group 20!

Its time to start working on Lab 3. I signed us up to do an =
architectural analysis on Puppet, a popular declarative software =
infrastructure management tool.=20

I=92ve created a public GitHub repository for us to coordinate.

The report and presentation slides are due by July 17th so this is our =
only weekend to prepare. I know everyone is busy =97 who thinks they=92ll =
have time this weekend to work on the report? I will be away but will =
have time to work on it.

Lets plan to meet next Wednesday to finalize everything, practice the =
presentation, and submit.

I think a good way to tackle this project would be for everyone to do =
some research, annotate the report file with point form comments, and =
then have one person go through and fill out the sections with prose =
writing (I volunteer myself).=20

Please respond to this email to let me know you got it!

Thanks
 - Lucas=
